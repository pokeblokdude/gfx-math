# GFX Math
This is a simple math library that implements common graphics functions. I made it for use with Arduino microcontrollers, but I'm sure it could be mildly useful in general programming as well.
## Installation
To use this in the Arduino IDE, simply place the files into a new folder in the `libraries` directory. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\Your_Name\Documents\Arduino\libaries`. I'm sure it's similar on Mac and Linux but I have no way of checking.
